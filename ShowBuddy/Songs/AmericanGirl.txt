Well, she was an American girl|Raised on promises|She couldn't help thinkin'|That there was a little more to life somewhere else|After all it was a great big world|With lots of places to run to|And if she had to die tryin'|She had one little promise she was gonna keep||O yeah, all right|Take it easy, baby|Make it last all night|She was an American girl||Well it was kind of cold that night,|She stood alone on her balcony|Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by,|Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach|And for one desperate moment|There he crept back in her memory|God it's so painful when something that's so close|Is still so far out of reach||O yeah, all right|Take it easy, baby|Make it last all night|She was an American girl|
