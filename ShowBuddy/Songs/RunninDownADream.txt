It was a beautiful day|The sun beat down|I had the radio on|I was drivin'|Trees flew by|Me and Del were singinâ€™|Little Runaway|I was flyin'|Yeah runnin' down a dream|That never would come to me|Workin' on a mystery|Goin' wherever it leads|Runnin' down a dream|I felt so good like anything was possible|I hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes|The last three days the rain was unstoppable|It was always cold|No sunshine|Yeah runnin' down a dream|That never would come to me|Workin' on a mystery|Goin' wherever it leads|Runnin' down a dream|I rolled on as the sky grew dark|I put the pedal down to make some time|There's something good waitin' down this road|I'm pickin' up whatever's mine|Yeah runnin' down a dream|That never would come to me|Workin' on a mystery|Goin' wherever it leads|Runnin' down a dream
